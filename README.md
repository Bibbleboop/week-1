# week-1
what have we learned so far

Not able to push to class frontend-dev folder even with branches
Daily should be ensuring on main (git checkout main) and (git pull) to update class files 
  Then change to my Bibbleboop branch before working on activities and using starter code in my work folders
Solutions for daily activiies are provided in the git pull the following day

When using links, for example for style.css or image links should use relative file paths. Absoloute file paths are no good as your C: is not in web


Do not add additional folders in starter code download as this casues issues when trying to move them afterwards ie Assets folder for Challenge 1 and other readme and challenge guides.
